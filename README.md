     Amine Platform is an (IDE) that allows developing many kinds of intelligent systems and agents. 
     The knowledge in Amine is represented using the Conceptual Graph (CG) formalism,in this work,
     we aim to integrate the generation of images from a CG in the Amine Platform using Generative
     Adversarial Networks(GANs), and scrapping the data that we will use in the training.
